- 👋 Hi, I’m @allen-brandon
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, competitive coding, and game design.
I'm perpetually fascinated by how others think, what to learn from them, and how to help them.

- 🌱 I’m always working to learn more computer science fundamentals.
Right now I'm learning C++, with my eyes set on Codeforces and UE5.

- 💞️ I’m looking for ways to foster community, sustainability, and genuine self-expression.
If you have a way you want to do that then hit me up.
